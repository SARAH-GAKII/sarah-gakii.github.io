# Hi, I‚Äôm <span class="accent">Sarah Gakii</span>

I‚Äôm an applied mathematician and data analyst with experience spanning mathematical modeling, AI training, and analytics.  
I recently earned my M.A. in Applied Mathematics & Scientific Computation from Bowling Green State University, where my thesis introduced a Newton‚ÄìFinite Difference Method for elliptic and parabolic PDEs with nonlinear interface jump conditions.

My work sits at the intersection of research, analytics, and impact. I‚Äôve taught Precalculus, College Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics using active-learning methods, and contributed as a Math & Data Analysis Expert in AI training, shaping high-quality reasoning datasets for advanced models.
