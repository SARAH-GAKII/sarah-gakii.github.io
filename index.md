    <h2 class="title">Hi, I’m <span class="accent">Sarah Gakii</span></h2>

I’m an applied mathematician and data analyst who turns complex problems into clear, actionable insights. I recently earned my M.A. in Applied Mathematics & Scientific Computation from Bowling Green State University, where my thesis introduced a Newton–Finite Difference Method for solving elliptic and parabolic PDEs with nonlinear interface jump conditions.

My work sits at the intersection of mathematical modeling, data analytics, and applied research. I’ve taught Precalculus, College Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics using active-learning approaches. Beyond academia, I’ve worked as a Math & Data Analysis Expert in AI training, shaping high-quality reasoning datasets for advanced models.

I’m motivated by problems that blend mathematics, data, and impact across research, education, and industry.
