# Hi, I’m <span class="accent">Sarah Gakii</span>

{: .lead }
I’m an applied mathematician and data analyst who turns complex problems into clear, actionable insights.  
I recently earned my **M.A. in Applied Mathematics & Scientific Computation** from Bowling Green State University, where my thesis introduced a **Newton–Finite Difference Method** for solving elliptic and parabolic PDEs with nonlinear interface jump conditions.

{: .lead }
My work sits at the intersection of **mathematical modeling, data analytics, and applied research**.  
I’ve taught Precalculus, College Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics using active-learning approaches.  
Beyond academia, I’ve worked as a **Math & Data Analysis Expert in AI training**, shaping high-quality reasoning datasets for advanced models.

{: .lead }
I’m motivated by challenges that blend mathematics, data, and impact—across **research, education, and industry**.  
Explore my portfolio to see how I approach problems end-to-end, and feel free to connect if our interests align.
