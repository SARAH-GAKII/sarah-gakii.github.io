  <h2 class="title">Hi, I’m <span class="accent">Sarah Gakii</span></h2>

  <p class="lead">
    I am an applied mathematician and data analyst with a passion for turning complex problems into actionable insights.
    I recently completed my M.A. in Applied Mathematics &amp; Scientific Computation at Bowling Green State University, where my thesis introduced a novel Newton–Finite Difference Method for solving elliptic and parabolic PDEs with nonlinear interface jump conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond academic research, I enjoy applying quantitative thinking to real-world contexts.
    Alongside my research, I’ve taught Precalculus, College Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics as a Graduate Assistant.
    I’ve worked as a Math &amp; Data Analysis Expert in AI training, helping shape the reasoning ability of machine learning systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m motivated by problems that blend mathematics, data, and impact, and enjoy finding practical solutions through quantitative thinking and collaborating across disciplines. Feel free to explore my experiences, and connect if you’d like to collaborate.
