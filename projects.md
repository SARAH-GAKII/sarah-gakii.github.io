## Tourism Attractions Capping Numbers  

At the Mathematics in Industry Study Group (MISG 2023), I worked with a team tackling a problem brought forward by an industry representative: how to determine fair and effective visitor caps for tourism attractions. This was an open-ended challenge with direct implications for resource management, sustainability, and economic planning.  

#### Context  
Tourism attractions often face the tension between maximizing revenue and preserving visitor experience and environmental sustainability. Setting a cap on visitor numbers is a practical necessity, but determining those caps requires careful balancing of variables such as attraction size, environmental impact, peak demand, and operating costs.  

#### Exploration  
Working as part of a group, I helped to:  
- Translate the industry question into a mathematical modeling problem.  
- Discuss assumptions and constraints, such as visitor flow, carrying capacity, and cost-benefit trade-offs.  
- Explore initial model formulations, which aimed to capture the dynamics of attraction use and guide optimal capping strategies.  

#### Reflection  
This project was a valuable opportunity to apply mathematical thinking to a live industry problem. It strengthened my skills in:  
- Problem formulation in open-ended, real-world contexts.  
- Team-based research under tight deadlines.  
- Communicating technical approaches to both academic and industry audiences.
