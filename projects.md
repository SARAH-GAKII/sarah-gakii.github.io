## Excel BI Dashboard (2025)
**Stack:** Excel (Power Query, PivotTables, dynamic charts)  
Built a **decision-ready dashboard** from raw financial/ops data.

- Automated data cleaning and shaping (Power Query).
- Clean KPI cards (MoM/YoY, variance), interactive slicers.
- Dynamic charts tied to filters; documented assumptions.

## Cooperative Policing Model (2023)
Mathematical model studying the impact of **community–police cooperation** on crime dynamics.

- Explored parameter regimes that reduce steady-state crime.
- Presented at AMU School 2023; collaborative work.

---

## Competing Species — Stochastic (2022)
Investigated **noise-driven** coexistence/competition outcomes.

- Parameter sweeps; visualization of phase behavior under stochasticity.
- Communication-friendly write-up for mentorship setting.

## More
- Numerical PDE solvers (finite difference) for interface problems.  
- Coursework mini-projects in probability, statistics, and optimization.
