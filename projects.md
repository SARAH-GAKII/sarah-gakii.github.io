# Selected Projects

### Excel Business Intelligence Dashboard  

Developed a full Excel-based Business Intelligence dashboard to demonstrate advanced data analysis and visualization skills. The project transformed raw financial data into actionable insights through:  

- Data cleaning and preparation.  
- Building PivotTables and PivotCharts for multi-dimensional analysis.  
- Creating interactive dashboards with slicers and dynamic charts.  
- Designing custom financial metrics to track performance and trends.  

This project showcases my ability to take raw datasets and build a tool that supports decision-making and business insights.

## Tourism Attractions Capping Numbers  

At the Mathematics in Industry Study Group (MISG 2023), I worked with a team tackling a problem brought forward by an industry representative: how to determine fair and effective visitor caps for tourism attractions. This was an open-ended challenge with direct implications for resource management, sustainability, and economic planning.  

#### Context  
Tourism attractions often face the tension between maximizing revenue and preserving visitor experience and environmental sustainability. Setting a cap on visitor numbers is a practical necessity, but determining those caps requires careful balancing of variables such as attraction size, environmental impact, peak demand, and operating costs.  

#### Exploration  
Working as part of a group, I helped to:  
- Translate the industry question into a mathematical modeling problem.  
- Discuss assumptions and constraints, such as visitor flow, carrying capacity, and cost-benefit trade-offs.  
- Explore initial model formulations, which aimed to capture the dynamics of attraction use and guide optimal capping strategies.  

#### Reflection  
This project was a valuable opportunity to apply mathematical thinking to a live industry problem. It strengthened my skills in:  
- Problem formulation in open-ended, real-world contexts.  
- Team-based research under tight deadlines.  
- Communicating technical approaches to both academic and industry audiences.

## A Stochastic Version of a Competing Species Model  

During the Mfano Africa â€“ Oxford Mathematics Virtual Mentorship Programme (2022), I completed a mini research project under the mentorship of Dr. Robert A. McDonald, exploring mathematical models of species competition.  

#### Context  
The project examined the competition between native red squirrels and invasive grey squirrels in the UK. Grey squirrels carry the squirrelpox virus, which is harmless to them but fatal to red squirrels, contributing to the decline of red squirrel populations. We sought to study these dynamics through mathematical modeling.  

#### Methodology  
- Constructed a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe redâ€“grey squirrel competition based on the competitive exclusion principle.  
- Analyzed the system to determine long-term outcomes depending on initial population sizes.  
- Implemented and visualized the ODE simulations using MATLAB.  
- Outlined how a stochastic extension could provide additional ecological realism, highlighting expected outcomes.  

#### Findings  
- The ODE-based model confirmed the competitive exclusion principle: two species with identical niches cannot coexist indefinitely.  
- Simulations showed that initial conditions strongly influence survival: whichever species begins with an advantage tends to dominate.  
- Highlighted that randomness in a stochastic model could delay or modify extinction outcomes, offering a natural direction for future research.  

#### Reflection  
This project strengthened my ability to translate ecological principles into dynamical systems models, perform computational simulations, and present technical findings in an international mentorship setting.
