## Competing Species (Stochastic) (2022)
Explored coexistence/competition regimes under randomness and initial conditions; sensitivity to noise and carrying capacities.  
- Methods: stochastic simulations, parameter sweeps, visualization.
- Outcomes: identified conditions for stability/oscillation under noise.
- (Add figures or link to code if available.)

## Cooperative Policing Model (2023)
Team research on crime dynamics emphasizing the impact of cooperative policing.  
- Modeled transitions between states, deterrence, and cooperation levels.
