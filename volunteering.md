# Volunteering  

## Habitat for Humanity – Women Build (Aug 2025-)

Contributed to residential construction projects as part of Habitat for Humanity’s Women Build initiative. My work supported affordable housing efforts while giving me hands-on exposure to building systems and teamwork in the field.  

- Assisted with siding installation, framing, soffits, and hurricane ties, gaining practical knowledge of structural stability.  
- Helped with electrical and plumbing preparations (socket holders, vent pipes, fan mounts).  
- Collaborated with skilled supervisors and diverse teams to ensure safe, efficient progress.  

This experience allowed me to connect my problem-solving and technical mindset to real-world community impact, while working in hands-on environments.
