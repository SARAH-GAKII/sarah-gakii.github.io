# Research & Thesis

## Thesis: Newton–Finite Difference Method (2025)
**Area:** Elliptic & Parabolic PDEs, nonlinear interface problems  
I developed a **Newton–Finite Difference** scheme for PDEs with **nonlinear interface jumps**—capturing discontinuities between media (e.g., layered materials/biological barriers).

**Highlights**
- Formulated Newton iteration with interface-aware finite differences.
- Proved/observed stability and convergence in numerical experiments.
- Benchmarked on canonical interface test problems; achieved accurate flux continuity.

**Keywords:** PDEs, interface conditions, finite difference, Newton iteration, numerical analysis

## Modeling Vaccine Uptake with Behavior & Epidemics (2023)
Coupled **evolutionary game dynamics** (human behavior) with an **epidemic model** to analyze how perceived costs/benefits drive vaccine acceptance.

**What I did**
- Built behavior–epidemics coupled system; explored equilibria.
- Ran parameter sweeps to study sensitivity and threshold effects.
- Interpreted policy implications for outreach and incentives.

## Crime Dynamics: Cooperative Policing (2023)
Team research exploring **cooperation** between communities and law enforcement, and its effect on crime prevalence.

**Focus**
- Simple dynamical model with transitions among states.
- Examined deterrence, reporting, and cooperation rates.
- Presented at AMU School 2023.

## Stochastic Competing Species (2022)
Explored **coexistence vs. competitive exclusion** under stochasticity.

**Notes**
- Simulated noise-driven dynamics and stability regions.
- Identified regimes sensitive to initial conditions/carrying capacities.
